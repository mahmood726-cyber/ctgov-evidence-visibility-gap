## `[31]` CT.gov Evidence Visibility Gap

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: Ghost-protocol rate among eligible older closed interventional studies  
**Data:** 249,507 eligible older closed interventional studies from the March 29, 2026 full-registry snapshot

### 156-word body

How visible is older interventional trial evidence in ClinicalTrials.gov when posted results and linked publications are read together rather than separately, actually? We analysed 249,507 closed interventional studies with primary completion at least two years before March 29, 2026, drawn from the full 578,109-study registry snapshot. Each eligible study was placed into one of four evidence states: results plus publication, results without publication, publication without results, or neither. Across eligible older studies, 42.7 percent showed neither posted results nor a linked publication, whereas only 13.7 percent showed both. Publication-only visibility remained common at 30.0 percent, and sponsor classes diverged sharply, with OTHER_GOV worst on ghost protocols at 49.1 percent while FED led on full visibility at 33.5 percent. Reading results tabs and linked papers together shows that older registry evidence is more often partially or wholly invisible than fully visible. These states measure registry-visible evidence coverage using internal CT.gov publication links, not exhaustive external bibliometric matching.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
